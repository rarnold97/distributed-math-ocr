- [ ] Add child loggers for sub-services
- [ ] add a client authentication system that requires credentials, and automatically knows user info under the hood
    - this way the user no longer needs to manually enter: `author_name`
- [ ] Make number of ml pipeline workers configurable
- [ ] Make Training batch size configurable
- [ ] Training Pipeline has to run twice in order to be successful.  Determin the cause of this!
- [ ] Update the resizer training pipeline, currently seeing a bug with the dataset length query.
